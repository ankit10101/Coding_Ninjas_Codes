/*
All Possible Ways

Given two integers a and b. You need to find and return the count of possible ways in 
which we can represent the number a as the sum of unique integers raise to the power b.
For eg. if a = 10 and b = 2, only way to represent 10 as -
10 = 1^2 + 3^2 
Hence, answer is 1.

Note : x^y represents x raise to the power y

Input Format :
Two integers a and b (separated by space)

Output Format :
Count

Constraints :
1 <= a <= 10^5
1 <= b <= 50

Sample Input 1 :
10 2

Sample Output 1 :
1

Sample Input 2 :
100 2

Sample Output 2 :
3
